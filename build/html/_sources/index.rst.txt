==========================================

About
-----
The TigerGraph CLI gives you access to manage your TigerGraph Cloud instances via the command line. Now you have the flexibility to use either our GraphStudio web interface or interact directly via command line. This opens up the possibility to utilize the TigerGraph CLI via a script and automate managing your TG Cloud solutions.

In addition, the CLI can be used in API mode which opens up the ability to manage your TG Cloud solutions via a REST API.
